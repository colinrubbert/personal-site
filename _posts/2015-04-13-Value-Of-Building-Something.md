In our modern society we take for granted all of the things that are manufactured and available to us. We have, for the most part, lost our connection to the things that we own and use because we no longer are involved in the manufacturing process. Everything is pre-processed, built, and shipped right to us. All of this is in the name of convenience but we lose the connection to the items we depend on each and every day.

I will be the first to say that I love anything that makes my life easier, that’s one of the reasons I’m in IT I can make a computer do the majority of my work, however, I do understand very well that I don’t feel a connection to all of the things I value in my life. The problem is that there is great value in building stuff for yourself and other people. Most of my career choices have been structured around building something, either physical goods, digital goods, or a mix of both. The things I found most enjoyable with all of the jobs that I have had are the parts where I got to build something.

There is a satisfaction that comes with building things that just consuming can’t trump. It’s what draws me to most of the things I do and I find a great level of fulfillment when I have taken an idea to prototype to final product. I’ve taken for granted most of things that I use but I the more I build things, the wider my eyes are and the more my brain looks at everyday objects and ponders what went into the process to deliver that good to me. It’s amazing how many people and how many ideas are involved with building an everyday good. The more you build the more you appreciate.

I’ve found a deeper connection to the things I do because of the things I build. Taking my ideas and building them gives me a greater sense of appreciation for what surrounds me. There is a simple beauty to constructing something with your own hands especially in an age where those skills are valued less and less. I challenge anyone to take some time and build something, anything. When you accomplish it, look at where you started from and appreciate the process. Then once you start doing that look around you and just think about the everyday objects you use, find the beauty and appreciation for the craftsmanship. Just build something.
