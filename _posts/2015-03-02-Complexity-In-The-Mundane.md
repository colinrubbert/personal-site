We take for granted the beautiful design we see all around the world and on the internet. We don’t spend enough time just thinking how difficult it was for the person to spend the time to design what you see. Take for instance building a website, it seems like it would be as easy as attributing a color to an element like “background: black;” and actually it can be this easy. If you just want a black background but there is so much more that goes into designing a website that makes it look good and appealing. There are tons of layers of creativity that goes into designing anything from products to websites.

Some one has to spend time on color theory, making sure to choose a color that invokes the proper emotional reaction (Mark Zuckerberg chose that blue on Facebook so you would feel relaxed and calmed, making sure you spend more time on it and continue to comeback), from there they will have to choose a complementary color palette that works nicely together, if there are buttons or boxes someone will have to make the call on whether or not those boxes or buttons should have a radius on the corners, should there be shadows on the boxes or flat, should the website have dynamic elements or static elements, and so much more. There is an amazing level of complexity when comes into designing a website, all the while making decisions that will either help or hinder the project. It goes the same for product design, your cell phones, cereal, noodles, clothes, shoes etc. There are intricate details that need to be accounted for that many of us just look back. Someone specifically made those conscious decisions to choose specific elements so that your product could be made and if they are lucky when we experience them we won’t be able to picture it any other way.

I think when talk about art we have a grand appreciation for the beauty and difficulty it was for that artist to create that piece but when it comes to what we see daily, like products and websites, we take for granted the complexity and difficulty that went into it and how hard someone really worked to design them the way you see them. Art is so much more than a painting on a wall or a photograph in a museum it’s product design, websites, brand design, brochures, labels, cars, books, scratch offs, and so much more. There is someone that has spent their precious time designing all of those things so that they invoke a certain response in relation to your psyche. Next time you look at a box of Fruity Pebbles or your favorite website take the time to appreciate the intricacies of what you see because someone spent the time to choose how every element would be placed, shaped, and colored. Design is an art and we often take for granted the complexity of the most mundane things because we don’t understand the effort that was put into it.
