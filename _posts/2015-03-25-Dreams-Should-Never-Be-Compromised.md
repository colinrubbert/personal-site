No matter what when it comes to your dreams you can’t compromise. There are many times that we will face rejection throughout our lives but we should never let that rejection compromise our goals and ambitions. If you aren’t doing what you love then stop doing it, find a way to follow your dream and make that a reality. There’s hard work involved when you got down that route but the hard work pays off in the long run. Life is a marathon not a sprint and you will die miserable and regretful if all you did was shit you hated.

I’ve recently embarked on a journey of knowledge to chase after one of the many dreams I’d like to see come to fruition in my lifetime. I’m already facing roadblocks and obstacles galore but like everything that is worth doing there are necessary to the character and knowledge building process. That’s life and it’s worth powering through. It doesn’t take much but perseverance and motivation to achieve your dream. I’m not delusional to think that all of the crazy dreams and hair brained endeavours will also be achieved or pay off but the journey is where its at and I’ve got plenty of backup plans just in case.

The point is no matter how many times I face rejection or obstacles, I don’t give up. I don’t accept defeat or failure because they’re just learning experiences for the next endeavour. You should take the same approach, why give up? Why take rejection as a personal slight at your character? Instead take it as a learning experience, use the things you fail at or fall short at to embolden you to do better the next time around. Obstacles are but moments of character development, use that to your advantage and you’ll never experience failure. Life is too short to be living a life not worth living, working jobs not worth working and not achieving your dreams and full potential. No compromise, ever.
