Twas the night before Christmas… The fat man packed up and on his way to come give us goodies for being good little boys and girls all year long. Christmas is by far my favorite holiday; the holiday cheer, humans being human to one another, and a small sense of purity in our tainted adult lives. Christmas is that time of year that we get to experience that carefree joy and peace that we held so cherished when we were children, at least to a small degree we can feel that purity we use to have.

As adults we have obligations, responsibilities, and life; it all makes us quite jaded. As children our lives were simple, we were carefree, Santa was real and we believed wholeheartedly in the magic of Christmas. It’s a shock to the system when we find out it the house of cars was all a rouse and it starts, I believe, when we find out that Santa isn’t real, that’s the point where reality starts to take hold and each passing year that we become closer to being adults we lose a piece of our carefree childhood. Then something happens at the end of each year, we get a piece of our childhood purity back with the holiday season. The thought of the magic fat man sneaks back into our minds and our hearts. And just like an infection we get wrapped up into the joy of Christmas once again.

Now many people can try and fight it, some succeed and some pretend, but I believe we all feel the joy of the season. I have come to realize the closest I ever get to being a kid as an adult is during the Christmas season. The lights, the snow, the songs, the movies, and the kindness we share towards one another brings me a great deal of happiness and joy. It is seriously the only part of winter I enjoy and it is the only reason why I would ever stay in a cold climate, to have the chance of a white Christmas.

This year we aren’t so fortunate to have that white Christmas, at least in my neck of the woods, but we are always fortunate to have the people we love and care about around us. Christmas for me use to be all about the free stuff but as I got older and cared less about material objects it became clear to me that Christmas isn’t about material items but spiritual items. The is an incredible sense of spiritual fulfillment when you get to be merry and joyous with the people that matter most to you. Spending time with my family on Christmas day is simply one of the best days of the entire year for me. The laughter, the traditions, the joy on their faces as they open their presents, and the gorging on delicious food; simply put there is nothing better than that. I find myself to be quite fortunate to have such an amazing experience year after year.

So on this Christmas Eve, whether you are; Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Buddhist, Atheist or whatever you may identify yourself as I wish you a very Merry Christmas. This year take a look around you when you are with the people you love on Christmas day and enjoy the purity of the moment. I hope you find a piece of your inner child and purity of heart in this holiday season and hope you can hold onto that into the new year. To all my friends, families, and complete strangers I wish you a wonderful, joyous, peaceful and most of all merry Christmas.
