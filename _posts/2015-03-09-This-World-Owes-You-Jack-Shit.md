This world owes you jack shit and if you think otherwise you are greatly mistaken. We aren’t born into a world that owes us anything, with great pain do I have to recognize that unfortunately my generation and the generations after me seem to think that we are owed something for just simply existing. It seems to be a plague within the younger generation, we expect that people are going to do things for us, that things are just going to work out and that someone is just going to give us great opportunities without asking nothing in return. This is flat out wrong.

In this life if you want something you have to take it, you need to bust your ass off and make things happen. We can’t just sit around, do nothing, and hope good fortune comes our way. It’s my experience that this just doesn’t happen. It took me longer than I would’ve liked to have realized this valuable life lesson and that’s why I’m talking about it. I hope that my generation and the ones after will learn from other’s mistakes and understand if you want something out of life, you need to make it happen, no one else can do it but you.

There is incredible value in working your ass off and hustling to a goal, this is ultimately the only way we get what we want out of life. It is a useless endeavor to sit around, barely work, and expect luck and opportunity to land in our laps. For some reason we seemed to have been born or raised with this stupid sense of pride but not good pride but misguided and misdirected pride. We feel that doing hard work and working shitty jobs are below us but we fail to understand that we all have to pay our fucking dues in this world. Even in your late 20s the likelihood that you will be working a job you don’t particularly like or leaves you unfulfilled is relatively high, especially nowadays but we can’t settle for the bullshit and a life of subordinary.

Each and every one of us have the potential to achieve great things. There **is** enough pieces of the pie to go and then again for seconds and thirds. There is opportunity and inspiration around every corner. But before you can have any pie you need to learn that you are not entitled to the pie, it is a reward and it is earned. We earn our slice by working our asses off for the things we love, we get no pie for sitting around doing jack shit and working jobs we hate. This world owes you nothing but it will reward you for effort, hard work, and passion. If we bust our asses, hustle, and work hard, life will eventually give us our key to the promise land of endless pie.
