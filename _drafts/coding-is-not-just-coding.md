**Just like martial arts, cooking, travelling, photography,** and nearly everything else that we do there are more to our activities than the activities themselves. Recently I’ve been realizing there is more to coding than just coding. I’ve noticed that when I code I’ve been discovering things about myself and my thoughts.

I practice mindfulness everyday, well I do my best sometimes I need more practice, and as a result of that I try to spend every moment in the moment. It’s given me the ability to appreciate life for what it is and truly enjoy every moment of life; good and bad, ups and down, and everything in between.

What I’ve noticed has been that while coding the things that have weighed me down throughout the day or stresses of the world diminish in strength and intensity. This has been a truly great experience, it seems that even when I’m focused on coding I’m able to work through the things that have been worrying or bothering me and by the time I finish coding I’ve got a solution or relief from the issue that was bothering me.

It’s not all about dealing with bad things or negative things so on the flip side while coding I’ve been able to hash out great ideas, business plans, and insights into who I am. I don’t believe that we ever truly figure out who we are and we’re always discovering things about ourselves and coding has given me the meditative practice to assist in exploring more of myself and my thoughts.

Coding is a craft, it’s not just a skill. It can be molded, honed, and sharpened like a razor sharp samurai sword. Coding is mental exercise that consists of being mindful of what you are doing and how that affects the world around it. Whether or not we realize it, we are meditating and practicing mindfulness, further crafting our abilities.

Truly brilliant coders are masters of mindfulness, they see the moment and beyond. They have intimate knowledge of how things work and how they can manipulate them to build something ever more amazing and beautiful. They’ve crafted their abilities into powerful tools for impacting the moments of our lives.

Coding is more than just coding, it’s a craft. The further we stay present in our code and be mindful of their interactions we can further develop our craft to something truly powerful. Code assists presents us with a meditative state to work through any concern or idea we may have on our mind. Once our skills grow our mind automates more and more of the task which results in more of our time spent empty (at true zen, a complete focus) or we discover things about ourselves and who we are, working through all the things that are in our lives good or bad.
