      <h1 id="fuck-monotony-follow-your-passions">Fuck Monotony, Follow Your Passions</h1>

<p>Find your passion and never give up. For too many of us we walk a path that wasn’t deliberately chosen by us, it was chosen for us. When we are children we are passionate about want to do <strong>BIG</strong> things like be astronauts, pirates, professional athletes, fearless explorers or a million other things that we see as exciting through the pure lens of a child’s eye. When we grow up though, our passions are replaced by practicality and purpose. But whose purpose and why do we need practicality, it dulls who we are and turns us into sleepwalkers in the maze of life.</p>

<p>I’ve been passionate about a lot of things throughout my life; women, careers, friends, family sports, arts, adventure and many many more. It isn’t long that these passions get replaced with the practicality of life, it happens and it happens to all of us, I’m not unique to this. I started writing and working hard to improve who I am because I finally had lost all my passion in life and I was settling for what everyone else wanted but never what I wanted. Writing has become my accountability tool, you guys and gals are my friends. You keep my ass in check making sure I keep doing the things that make me passionate.</p>

<p>I think we spend a lot of wasted time pursuing things that ultimately don’t make us happy, they are things that people think we should be doing and things that have been beaten into us over the years. I’m telling you enough is enough! No longer will we be unhappy, no longer will we aimlessly walk through this life, no longer will we work shit jobs for shit people doing shit work for shit pay, and no longer will we sacrifice our happiness for a life of mundane monotony. We have lived far too long allowing everyone else to control our lives and it’s time to pursue the things that make us happy, we need to follow our passions!</p>

<p>Passion is what brings us happiness. We should never give up our passions for a life of complacency and average. We are <strong>NOT</strong> average! We can be great, we can be excellent, and we can live an extraordinary life with tons of amazing stories to be told, spread and shared with the masses. For far too long we have been told to follow a certain path, do things a certain way and live our lives by other peoples standards, for what? The broken “American Dream”? It’s a fallacy, a lie we’ve been told since we were children, it doesn’t exist anymore. Today we need to say <strong>“Fuck the American Dream! I’m living my dream! My way! You can’t stop me! I will be passionate about life and I will be happy with the world I make!”</strong> Stop following other people’s dreams, follow your own, make a commitment today that you will work your ass off to follow your passions!</p>
