            </div>
              <p>I’ll never go back to doing a website without a mockup. That was my big takeaway from this last week. I experienced the pain the previous week with multiple site redesigns, scraping ideas and having to start over because I had no clear vision of the direction that I wanted to go. In the last week I finished up a...</p>

              <p>WooHoo another week done and much accomplished. This week I got an MVP done, an MVP of my business website (which I’ll end up trashing and starting over because why not), and halfway through building a custom Jekyll theme that I can use for potential clients in the near future. I switched up my mindset this last week and kicked...</p>

              <p>Another week done and gone. My big concerns and focuses this week in my web dev pursuits was more so on the business side of things. With my recent decision to go freelance I’ve launched into research and development mode. Having a history of IT consulting, working for small businesses, and knowing many small business owners I definitely have some...</p>

              <p>Having taken a couple of side jobs this week I didn’t get to put as much time into coding as I had hoped this week but it all works in the larger scheme of things for my next move. Currently I’ve been working to build out my IT consulting business and currently gearing up to include web design and development...</p>

              <p>I stepped away for a little bit to regain my breath since I’ve been working 60-70 hours a week for the last month I needed a bit of break so this will be a web dev recap on this last week but not the week before. Sometimes you just need to step away and recapture your breath. The biggest thing...</p>

            </div>
              <p>This week was filled with a bunch of fun code related activities from lightning talks, frontend JS validations, frontend styling and jQuery mobile menus. It’s been an interesting week with lots of new learning experiences. It’s all kind of merged into a single day it seems but it was, for me, a very productive and educational experience. Starting out in...</p>
