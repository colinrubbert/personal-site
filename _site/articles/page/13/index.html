              <p>Find your passion and never give up. For too many of us we walk a path that wasn’t deliberately chosen by us, it was chosen for us. When we are children we are passionate about want to do BIG things like be astronauts, pirates, professional athletes, fearless explorers or a million other things that we see as exciting through the...</p>

            </div>
              <p>When I decided that I would instead stop settling for average and mundane I needed to figure out what made the extraordinary people extraordinary. I’ve spent a good 6 months thinking about this concept and trying to figure out what makes people stand out from other people. How can an average person go from unremarkable to unmistakable. I think I...</p>

              <p>Winter always sucks me dry and I often lose my motivation and creativity during the dreary, cold, and short days of winter. I hate it, very much. I don’t think it is a mystery why things slow down and we become complacent with what we need to do. I will perpetually blame it on the weather. You see when winter...</p>

              <p>With the new year comes new years resolutions and promises to ourselves. Really it’s the best way to start off a new year with ambition and excitement about making a change in our lives. It’s positive, good, and empowering. Unfortunately changing the things that matter is hard and we have big expectations for the change we choose to make. That’s...</p>

              <p>That’s it folks, in less that 24 hours another year will be over and put in the history books. 2014 was a pretty good year for many of us. It had highs, lows, and in betweens but 2015 is going to be a big year. I can only speak for myself but as far as I can see it there...</p>

              <p>Like all things 2014 must come to an end. It was a year of massive highs, lows, and a lot of mediocrity. I have faced success, failure, rejection, heartache, joy, compassion, and a million other experiences. I have made drastic declarations, dedicated myself to becoming better, and pushing past any barriers that I have faced. 2014 in retrospect was a...</p>
