              <p>It’s been over month since I started to learn how to code using Ruby on Rails. It was intended to be a motivational tool to kick off learning something new every month and it has turned into something I wouldn’t have expected. Since I’ve been doing it I have felt more creative and far more fulfilled than I would’ve imagined....</p>

              <p>Killing off excuses are the first step to start making positive changes in your life. It’s sometimes difficult to stop making excuses for not achieving the things that you wish to achieve. It’s easy to blame money, geography, the social class you were born into, time, and a whole lot more. Why wouldn’t you blame your lack of motivation and...</p>

              <p>There’s moments in life where things are just so damn complicated. As humans we tend to pile the shit on and complicate life even more, it seems to be our natural states. On one hand it’s quite impressive from what we have evolved into and on the other hand we seemed to have evolved to a point where we try...</p>

              <p>This world owes you jack shit and if you think otherwise you are greatly mistaken. We aren’t born into a world that owes us anything, with great pain do I have to recognize that unfortunately my generation and the generations after me seem to think that we are owed something for just simply existing. It seems to be a plague...</p>

              <p>We take for granted the beautiful design we see all around the world and on the internet.

Take for instance building a website, it seems like it would be as easy as attributing a color to an...</p>
