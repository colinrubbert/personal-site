            </div>
              <p>No matter what when it comes to your dreams you can’t compromise. There are many times that we will face rejection throughout our lives but we should never let that rejection compromise our goals and ambitions. If you aren’t doing what you love then stop doing it, find a way to follow your dream and make that a reality. There’s...</p>

              <p>It’s been over month since I started to learn how to code using Ruby on Rails. It was intended to be a motivational tool to kick off learning something new every month and it has turned into something I wouldn’t have expected. Since I’ve been doing it I have felt more creative and far more fulfilled than I would’ve imagined....</p>

              <p>Killing off excuses are the first step to start making positive changes in your life. It’s sometimes difficult to stop making excuses for not achieving the things that you wish to achieve. It’s easy to blame money, geography, the social class you were born into, time, and a whole lot more. Why wouldn’t you blame your lack of motivation and...</p>

              <p>There’s moments in life where things are just so damn complicated. As humans we tend to pile the shit on and complicate life even more, it seems to be our natural states. On one hand it’s quite impressive from what we have evolved into and on the other hand we seemed to have evolved to a point where we try...</p>
