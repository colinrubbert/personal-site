          </div>
            <p>Life is funny like that, jumping into something that I never would’ve thought I would’ve enjoyed turns into something that I really do love. Opened doors and exciting times all comes from jumping in blind and trying to discover life and new opportunities. See there are some, in my opinion, unexplainable forces in the Universe that pushes and pulls us...</p>

          </div>
            <p>I think doing something out of your comfort zone where you aren’t that confident in your ability is a great way to develop yourself as a person. When we pursue things that are a bit outside of our day to day norms and abilities we get presented with opportunities to expand who we are and how we think. Learning new...</p>

          </div>
            <p>It’s always a great experience when serendipity strikes when you start learning something new. I often find myself learning or trying new things but at the same time have no place to apply those new skills and they atrophy quickly. Since I have a massive amount of curiosity and interest in a ton of different things I have a tendency...</p>

          </div>
            <p>One day you will come to realize, if done correctly, your shitty job you wake up to every morning that leaves you completely unfulfilled will be the best thing for your success as a person. You wake up every morning thinking to yourself, what the fuck am I doing? At one point or another we all experience this job, some...</p>

          </div>
            <p>I love learning, I enjoy consuming knowledge, trying things I previously didn’t know, and building things that I never knew how to build. There’s a lot to be said about the struggle of learning something new, it can strengthen the learning process and give you an ability to retain the information for a little bit longer and a bit stronger....</p>

          </div>
            <p>I’ve talked about mindfulness before, being in the moment and recognizing what is going on around you and inside you. I’ve recently just had to deal with some stressful family issues and work issues all during the least opportune timing, thus “Surviving The Shit Storm” post I had last week. Things have been emotional with plenty of ups, downs, stresses,...</p>
