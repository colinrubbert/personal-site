            </div>
              <p>As anyone who reads this knows I’ve been learning how to code, focusing primarily on web development. In all the attempts that I have conducted in the world of coding there has always been moments where I hit brick walls and give up. Not this time thought, I’ve vowed that this time I will not give up. In the last...</p>

            </div>
              <p>In our modern society we take for granted all of the things that are manufactured and available to us. We have, for the most part, lost our connection to the things that we own and use because we no longer are involved in the manufacturing process. Everything is pre-processed, built, and shipped right to us. All of this is in...</p>

            </div>
              <p>The greatest way to fulfillment is through series of challenges. I’ve found that the greatest moments in my life have come out of being challenged to a point where I nearly gave up and I felt hopeless. I get bored pretty easily when it comes to working, hobbies, really doing anything because once it’s no longer a challenge I lose...</p>

            </div>
              <p>There’s a lot of uncertainty when it comes to making big life choices. I’m a pretty confident guy and I am very rarely ever not cool, calm, and collected. I certainly wouldn’t show my reservations or uncertainty externally but I too am affected by uncertainty and doubt. I’ve been playing tug of war with uncertainty and my confidence recently, I’m...</p>

              <p>Remember that when you are cursing the Gods for your misfortune it may be entirely your fault. I’ve spent 27 years on this Earth and if there is one takeaway from all that time is that good things happen to positive people and bad things happen to negative people. It’s pretty easy blaming our misfortunes on magical deities or our...</p>

I know I’ve discussed the joys of learning something new and I really can’t stress enough how important it is for everyone to spend some time and learn a new skill. Learning skills aren’t pointless because you don’t use them at work or...</p>
