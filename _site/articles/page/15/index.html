            </div>
              <p>I’m not a very angrily reactive man, for the most part it takes me some real severe agitation for me to snap or a prolonged build up without a release or relaxation period. In many of more recent adult years I have learned to manage and tame my anger, especially in constructive manners. This has not been the case for...</p>

            </div>
              <p>I’m feeling a bit different today from the days prior, I feel a slight increase in energy and ambition after spending many days off script and not in a good way, so unproductive. I received a bit of inspiration yesterday evening and it seems to have fueled a subtle, but not unnoticeable, flame inside of me. Simply put, I’m getting...</p>

              <p>I use to hate waking up in the morning, if it was before 9 I cursed the world. I think having to be forced to wake up early to go to school or work as a kid was what made me dread the wee hours of the morning. As I got older and as I had to work manufacturing jobs...</p>

              <p>To get shit done is one of the best feelings ever, to not get the shit done that you wanted to get done is one of the worst. It’s not hard to fall short of the things that you set out to do, it really isn’t, I do it all the time. Actually, if I didn’t know any better I...</p>

              <p>Happiness is a thing of beauty, sometimes hard to obtain and hold on to but something the majority of people want. It is ultimately my everyday goal in my personal repertoire. At the end of the day I want to know that the things I did made me happy, big or small. I think happiness is essential to having a...</p>

              <p>There is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so. ~ William Shakespeare I’ve been thinking about this concept a lot lately for some reason and it’s just hanging in my head. It’s an interesting concept because of how factual it proves to be. It’s an excellent example of Stoic optimism. Many of us spend a good majority...</p>
