              <p>A week into my web dev gig and there’s a TON of information that has been consumed with a faulted attempt to process it in a reasonable way. My task for this contract is to get up to speed as soon as I can with, from my point of view, a fairly complicated codebase. I like the challenge though. Things...</p>

              <p>I’ve talk about mindfulness in the past and the value it has as a daily practice. I’m here to tell you it’s no different today than it was when I wrote it over 6 months ago. If you haven’t read it I’ll get you up to speed. I practice on a daily basis the art of mindfulness, it really is...</p>

              <p>BOOM! What’s that? Oh just the crack from what was another round of epic lightning talks. This week may not have been heavy with code but it sure was heavy with a lot of great information about code, seeing opportunities, and capitalizing on the situation but there was still code, there’s always code. I love coding too much now that...</p>

              <p>Every week that I get to spend time coding is a good week and I got the chance to do a lot of coding this week. From lightning talk app: learning helper methods and learning how to seed a database, contributing to open source, and getting my questions answered on 5by5 Ruby on Rails podcast. There was a lot of...</p>

              <p>If you’re not passionate about what you’re doing then you’re doing it wrong. Passion for the things that you do is incredibly important, it directly affects quality of life and general happiness. Passion is a powerful force, I’d argue it’s one of the top 3 emotions only behind love and fear. To not be living a passionate life could potentially...</p>

              <p>Here we are once again for another web development week in review. Most of the week was comprised of building an app for the Firehose community lightning talks, meetups, visiting Hashrocket, diving into date_select, getting parameter errors, patching data through links, and battling migration issues. The more I dive into web development the more I get hooked, it’s all I...</p>
