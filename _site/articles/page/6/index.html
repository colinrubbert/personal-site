          </div>
            <p>One of the greatest things you can do when you start to build up a new skill or passion is to find a community that shares your interest. When finding that community it can give you a great opportunity to quickly expand your skills by leveraging the knowledge of your peers and mentors. It’s amazing to see the many people...</p>

          </div>
            <p>Another week in the bank, today I’m rounding out week 6 of theFirehoseProject bootcamp. Like every week of this bootcamp I’ve learned some cool things, battled with a few others, and found some wonderful pieces of advice. I’ve gone from sticking to a template and building a simple CRUD application to starting to implement my own features. Finding the resources...</p>

          </div>
            <p>I’m an imposter and a fake and I fucking love it! I’m not ashamed of being an imposter, not at all, it means I’m jumping far outside of my comfort zone to become something that I’m currently not. It’s passion, challenge and excitement that leads me down the road of imposter syndrome. I’ve always kind of lived by the motto...</p>

          </div>
            <p>Week 5 is in the bag. Today I start moving on to week 6 of theFirehoseProject dev bootcamp. It’s been another great week of learning, frustrations, and breakthroughs. With being roughly a third of the way through the program this is a big milestone of progression. This is also the week that I can my learning into overdrive so the...</p>

          </div>
            <p>Oh boy what an exciting and brutal week! The training wheels were taken off and I’m a bit wobbly still. My forward momentum isn’t quite efficient enough to keep me from touching down a foot frequently to brace myself from impacting the ground. The week was surrounded with free reign to build something I’m passionate about. Like I mentioned last...</p>

          </div>
            <p>Sometimes you just need to think things through all the way before jumping into something. I’m the type of person who just loves to jump in. I get excited what can I say? I’m anxious to do something new and often times I forget that I haven’t quite thought everything through. It results in having to back peddle and fix...</p>
