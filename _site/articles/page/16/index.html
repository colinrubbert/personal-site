          </div>
            <p>Reading is an essential cornerstone of creativity and not just reading junk blogs and the “news”. When I talk about reading I talk about reading stuff of substance whether it be self-improvement, nonfiction, fiction, or manuals on how to build something; if it adds value to your life in a positive way you should be reading it. For the last...</p>

          </div>
            <p>In the last month I have steadily been mainlining the Unmistakable Creative podcast including all of the 400+ backlog of interviews. Everyday I listen to at least 1 if not 2 of the hour long podcasts with someone who would be considered unmistakable. The Unmistakable Creative podcast is hosted by Srini Rao, Srini interviews the instigators, innovators, creatives, and leaders...</p>

          </div>
            <p>In over your head is a state of being, it’s a place where you are forced to produce, react, and progress quickly. If you are any good at learning on the the fly, winging it, or thrive under pressure then it is likely that you live in over your head. Frankly this is the perfect state to be in, constantly...</p>

          </div>
            <p>Being of the moment and being mindful of our feelings can be a great asset in personal progress. Many people, I could go so far as saying the majority of people especially in the US, are not conscious in the moment. They don’t rationally or objectively assess their feelings, thoughts and emotions. We get pissed off, angry, scream, rage, curse...</p>

          </div>
            <p>Fantasy, imagination, the unconscious mind, and the subconscious brain have long captured my thoughts and attention. I find it fascinating that even when our logical brains and our extremely rationed realities seem to be the dominate force in our daily lives that there is always a part of our brain spiking in and out of influence. However, from research, we...</p>

          </div>
            <p>Our brains are like any other muscle in our bodies (yes I know the brain isn’t an actual muscle but that’s besides the point). It needs to be exercised, flexed, stressed, worked, nurtured, and massaged like any other muscle in the body. Everyday I set out to do two simple things, or not simple depending on the days perspective, I...</p>
