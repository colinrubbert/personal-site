              <p>Twas the night before Christmas… The fat man packed up and on his way to come give us goodies for being good little boys and girls all year long.

              <p>It’s amazing how one simple act can have massive impacts on creative stimulation and creative process. Lately I have had many interruptions into my daily life, the interruptions themselves are not necessarily bad things, in fact they are important and need to be handled.

You would think formally living and frequently visiting Chicago that there wouldn’t be much to explore or discover that I hadn’t previously stumbled upon before, you would be wrong. Each time I visit that city I find something new. It’s either...</p>
