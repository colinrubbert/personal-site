            <p>It’s an odd feeling to start out fresh again, it’s uncomfortable, and sometimes disheartening but at the same time exciting. I’m just about wrapped up with my time at The Firehose Project and about ready to start a new career as a full stack web developer. Having to start out on a new career path means I’m starting out at...</p>

            <p>Now that week 13 is a wrap it means that my time at the Firehose Project is pretty much over, well in the sense of actual accountability and progression through the course. Last week wasn’t packed with as much code as I would’ve like it to have been but I was also on a micro vacation which I really needed....</p>

            <p>Wow, it’s coming very close to an end. Now that week 12 is all wrapped up I’ve started to get this weird reverse senioritis. I have one more mentor session left and roughly 2 to 3 more group sessions left and I’m officially all done with the Firehose Project. Historically whenever I got close to finishing up my time at...</p>

            <p>Week 11, how? How does it feel like this whole thing has ran at hyperspeed? I feel like these last weeks have gone by far too fast and each week that I get closer to the finishing line it feels like the week goes by faster and faster. It’s insane. Anyways week 11 is all over now and it sure...</p>

            <p>When I think about people who are successful and those who are not so lucky I wonder what separates the two. Everyone dreams of being successful, it’s not like you just wake up one morning and say “hey, you know what, I want to be a lazy good for nothing failure for the rest of my life”, absolutely not. So...</p>

            <p>Oh boy week 10 is all done. My time is coming to a near end and it’s sort of depressing in a bittersweet sort of way. Anyways lets just get on with what I learned over the last week. My week consisted of Chess logic, tests, coding challenges, and taking a bit of a breather to enjoy some laughs. The...</p>
