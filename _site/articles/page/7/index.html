            </div>
              <p>Sometimes you just need to think things through all the way before jumping into something. I’m the type of person who just loves to jump in. I get excited what can I say? I’m anxious to do something new and often times I forget that I haven’t quite thought everything through. It results in having to back peddle and fix...</p>

            </div>
              <p>Week 3 of theFirehoseProject has been easy, difficult, informative, frustrating, and a ton of more emotions in between. The week hasn’t been imparticularly that difficult and I have managed to get a lot done. Nomster is officially done and I’m pretty psyched with where I am at in my progression of the course. 3 weeks completed and 2 apps already...</p>

            </div>
              <p>Exploring new ideas, experiences, hobbies, and careers paths are about being able to handle the frustration of being completely over your head. I’ve never been one to take things on that I knew wouldn’t be a challenge. If I wanted to settle, never be challenged and never take risks I would’ve stayed a metal fabricator. The more I dive deep...</p>

              <p>Week 2: done and done! My second week of theFirehoseProject has come and now gone. It’s been an interesting week with some really valuable lessons learned. It’s amazing still how much I have been enjoying coding. It’s the part of my day that really brings me a sense of accomplishment and fulfillment. There is really a sense of joy and...</p>

              <p>Having experienced Death’s icy grips at least twice in my short 27 years on this Earth I have a unique perspective on just how short life is and can be. I’ve been living on borrowed time for nearly a decade now and then again a little over 5 years ago, simply put I should not be here writing this, I...</p>

              <p>Prequel Technically speaking Monday marked my first week with the Firehose Project’s full stack web development bootcamp but since today was the first office hours/group session I will consider today to be my first week. Anyways this is just to be a record of my journey through the bootcamp. I plan on doing a weekly overview of what we have...</p>
