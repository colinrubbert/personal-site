            <p>As someone who has focused on personal growth and development, a key factor of my life is to always be evolving and to accept the change. The thought of evolution sparked in my mind this morning when thinking about my progression over the last year and more importantly with this blog. I started out wanting to do something creative and...</p>

            <p>Now that I got a bit of a routine with scheduling weekly wrap ups on Wednesdays I think I’m going to make this a permanent staple of my writing. Wednesdays will be weekly wrap day, seems to work out nicely. It also gives me a way to cheat and now have to think too hard on coming up with a...</p>

            <p>How can I even start this without just first saying “Thank You”, thank you for such an amazing experience. Thank you to Jim, Jen, the whole Adorable team, volunteers, speakers, and attendees. Thank you for the conversations, the inspiration, the feels, the new friendships and connections. Thank you for Ruby Karaoke, an event that I certainly will never forget! Just...</p>

            <p>One week AF (After Firehose) and I’m still fully submerged in web development awesome sauce. I had thought that with the bittersweet ending of the Firehose Project that I would be unfocused and feel lost but instead of just saying goodbye and checking out, I doubled down on the community. I had figured that the week after the Firehose Project...</p>

            <p>I’ve had a few days now to come to terms with the fact that theFirehoseProject is all over. It’s been an amazing ride over the last 3 months and the skills I learned will leverage me into my next career pivot. I’ve met some really great people, experienced horrible frustrations, and felt amazing triumphs. I’ve went from slowly trudging through...</p>

            <p>That’s a wrap folks! It’s sad to say those words. I’ve spent the last 14+ weeks (including the pre-work weeks) with the Firehose Project and tonight was my exit interview and my final group meeting. I currently have a bunch of mixed emotions joy, sadness, accomplishment, pride, belonging, and so many more. While most the emotions I have from this...</p>
