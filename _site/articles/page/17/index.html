            <p>Last weekend I was planning on taking a little day trip to Madison to do some photography and as I was sitting there thinking about the choice of words I was using in my head I had realized that I was using phrases that were incredibly passive and didn’t hold much weight. Words and phrases like: maybe, might, I’ll let...</p>

            <p>Sometimes the struggle to do the things that are necessary when you just don’t feel like doing them is the most difficult thing in the world. Having the fortitude to push through and accomplish the things you want to do is quintessential for success. Just like the addict we all have that nagging little negative voice in our head telling...</p>

            <p>You’re “friends” don’t matter and you should stop caring so much about them. When I speak about “friends” I’m talking about the online interactions that we have developed because of social media. The people who we view of as friends on social media like Facebook or Twitter are, in all reality, not our friends in the traditional terms. They are...</p>

            <p>I have recently set out to experiment on myself in the method of replacing bad habits with positive creative habits in my daily morning routine. The goal and task has been to ignore any social media, emails, “news”, and general unhealthy distractions in the morning and to replace them with reading inspirational material, writing, or doing anything creative. The task...</p>

            <p>I’m going to keep it a bit more on the lighter side tonight. Not everything needs to be profound and awe inspiringly brilliant, it’s not sustainable. Instead of digging deep and writing something prolifically life altering I’m just going to lay out some goals, dreams, and aspirations. There has been, over the years, TONS of things that I have wanted...</p>

            <p>Gratitude is so often overlooked in this day in age so stop being an ungrateful piece of shit. We often think that the world revolves around us and even if we don’t believe that we are still extremely ungrateful for the things the earth provides and things people do for us on a daily basis. While we may say we...</p>
