        <h1>Excuses Are Like Assholes</h1>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="posts-wrapper">
      <p>Killing off excuses are the first step to start making positive changes in your life. It’s sometimes difficult to stop making excuses for not achieving the things that you wish to achieve. It’s easy to blame money, geography, the social class you were born into, time, and a whole lot more. Why wouldn’t you blame your lack of motivation and execution on all of your shortcomings? Who actually wants to take responsibility for their own missed shots? Not many.</p>

<p>I’m no different or rather I use to be like that, blame everything that has gone wrong in my life on someone or something else. I lacked every shred of integrity, why take the heat when someone else can? Then I grew the fuck up and realized I needed to start taking responsibility for my own actions, own up to all my shortcomings and mistakes. It was difficult in the beginning but once I got use to acknowledging my own mistakes I started to make less of them and I started to make good decisions instead of my traditional bad.</p>

<p>It’s not enough to just take ownership of your mistakes, you need to stop making excuses for the shit you aren’t doing that you want to do. The thing is we live in a place and time in history where literally the whole world is at our fingertips. We have an unprecedented ability to reach millions if not billions of people, if we work hard enough. Nearly any business can be started with less than $100 if executed properly. We’ve got incredible access to talk to big names in our desired industries, if I wanted to I could make a pretty solid attempt to talk to Bill Gates, Sergey Brin (in fact I have had some back and forth on social media), Tim Cook, Barack Obama, or anyone else you desire. I’ve been able to talk to people I admire in companies that I dream to work at, I’ve talked to celebrities, I’ve had interesting conversations with people halfway around the world. There is literally no reason for your excuses because you’ve got every opportunity in the world to make them happen.</p>

<p>Today instead of saying “but I don’t have this” or “don’t have that” or “I can’t” (my most hated word in the english language) just do it. Take ownership and admit to yourself that when you make those statement what you’re really saying is that I’m too lazy to work for it or too scared to take the risk. Get off your ass and execute. Work for the shit you want in life. Take the time to make positive directional moves. It’s really not that hard you just have to drop the stupid excuses because they’re not working for you. It’s no one’s fault but your own for not having the things that you want in life. Sure there are exigent circumstances but if you really wanted it, you would find a way out of that circumstance and chase after it with all your will and might. Do yourself a favor and stop making excuses.</p>
