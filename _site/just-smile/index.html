        <h1>Just Smile</h1>
      </div>

    <div class="posts-wrapper">
      <p>Over the brief 27 years and 2 humbling restarts that I have had in my life I have learned that one of the easiest and quickest ways to improve your life, especially in the moment, is to smile. It doesn’t take much even though at certain times it can be feel impossible but a smile can go a long way to changing your day or making it that much better. I do my best to always be smiling even if it is just a slight upturn of my lips. I really think it has been the primary reason why I have not gone crazy or become horribly depressed.</p>

<p>For anyone who has known me throughout my life knows that things weren’t always the easiest, I’ve gone through hell and back far too many times. There’s been so many moments where I wanted to give up and give in but I kept going. In the dark days, like everyone one time or another experiences, all I had to do is smile just a little bit and things weren’t so difficult. I had to accept that things aren’t the greatest, and sure there were times where I never thought I would be able to come back, but all it took was a smile, a kind simple gesture that costs nothing but makes a massive difference.</p>

<p>I remember all the smiles that showed me that they wouldn’t give up on me and that I shouldn’t give up on myself, for those people who showed that kindness and hope I will never forget and I will always be grateful. It’s a big reason why I do my best to always smile because you never know how that smile is going to change your life or someone else’s. It really is a massive switch in daily perception when you smile, it can immediately change your world. The more you smile the more you welcome good things which results in more smiles. I look at smiling as one of the single most important things anyone can do in their lives.</p>

<p>I really think that everyone has had a moment where they were really down and out, then there was that one person, your mother, father, sister, brother, best friend or complete stranger that looked you deep in your eyes and just smiled and that was the moment things were going to be okay. Like I said it doesn’t take much but has limitless return on investment. It’s important to take the time and do all you can to smile.</p>

<p>A simple smile can change the world. A simple smile can open the world up for endless possibilities. To smile is to appreciate the world you live in, to accept yourself for who you are and not what the world wants you to be. I have confidence when I wear a smile, the world sees that, and the world responds. When I was younger I thought I had to look stern and tough, that that was going to be the way I will make my place in the world but all I was doing was shutting myself off from opportunities. Now when I smile I know everything will be great and opening myself up to the world has rewarded me in ways that I’m still discovering. All you have to do is smile and everything will be alright!</p>
